## Reporting a vulnerability

Report security issues privately via GitHub Security Advisories on
[qntx/ur.js](https://github.com/qntx/ur.js/security/advisories/new), or email
`security@qntx.org` if that channel is unavailable.

Please include:

- Affected version and runtime (Node/Bun/browser)
- Minimal reproduction (URI/part bytes preferred)
- Impact assessment (e.g. decoder resource exhaustion, CRC bypass)

Do not open public issues for unfixed vulnerabilities.

## Threat model (summary)

This library is a **UR transport codec**. L5 `@qntx/ur/registry` adds structured
dCBOR objects (`seed`, `hdkey`, `keypath`, `coin-info`, `sskr`, `psbt`, `envelope`).
It does not implement application cryptography or trust policies. L5 output is
untrusted structured data; signing and key use are host policy.

| Seed / PSBT / SSKR share logged                | High                 | Codecs never stringify payloads. Switch on `CborError.code`. Never pass payload hex into `CborError.custom`              |
| Treating recovered L5 objects as trusted       | High (host)          | L5 output is untrusted structured data. Signing and key use are host policy                                              |

| Application payload treated as trusted         | High (host)          | L4 `CborDecode`/`CborType` for typed hosts; L5 objects still untrusted; L3 recovered bytes still untrusted               |

Hosts scanning untrusted QR streams must keep default limits (or tighter) and
treat recovered payloads as untrusted input. A poisoned `Decoder` is discarded;
construct a new instance.
