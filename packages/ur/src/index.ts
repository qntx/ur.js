/**
 * Uniform Resources (UR) for JavaScript/TypeScript.
 *
 * Root barrel: 1.0 transport freeze — opaque payload bytes plus a type token.
 * Bytewords, fountain codes, and UR encode/decode. No dCBOR parse
 * and no application type registry.
 *
 * L4 typed dCBOR lives on `@qntx/ur/typed` and is the first dCBOR parse
 * in this package. This root does not import dcbor.
 *
 * Do not rely on deep imports of RNG/fountain helpers unless documented
 * as supported subpath exports.
